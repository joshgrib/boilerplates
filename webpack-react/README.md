# mealplan-datavis
A React app to visualize and play with meal plan data

## Intro
I started looking into the meal plans at school to see what the actual value of each was compared to buying food per-meal. From there I looked into different meal times and locations to see how that would affect it. After making a spreadsheet for that in google sheets I decided the best way for myself and others to interact and see the data would be through a web app, and also I love web apps.

I've been meaning to make a project to learn React for a while now, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity. I'm also aiming to keep this as a really clean repo(in the beginning at least), so I can use it as boilerplate later, because I'm also going to set up the environment.

To set up the environment I'm going to follow this [Scotch.io article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel).


## Next steps
* Make MealCard and MealList
* Add side menu to switch between meal info, plan info, and the table
* Make list items not clickable or highlighting on mouseover
